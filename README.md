# UnitTesting
Simple Unit Testing using the Fibonacci.java 

Changed the Fibonacci.java a bit so that I could make the unit test file a bit simpler.

**Problems: When I do the test, I keep having to enter the iteration step twice. I tried to move things around but I couldn't figure it out, would there be a way to make it so that you only have to enter the iteration step once and it works for both tests?

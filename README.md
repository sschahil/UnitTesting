# UnitTesting
Simple Unit Testing using the Fibonacci.java 

This test is for a specific number of iterations, in this case it is 10. 
-The first test is for the amount of iteration steps.
-The second test sums the total sequence and tests it against the value it should be for the fibonacci sequence with 10 iterations. 

**Problems: When I do the test, I keep having to enter the iteration step twice. I tried to move things around but I couldn't figure it out, would there be a way to make it so that you only have to enter the iteration step once and it works for both tests?
